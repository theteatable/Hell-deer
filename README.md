The current plan is to take a given number (which will be assumed to be the multiple of two random prime numbers) and attempt to find
the prime roots via building blocks of possibilities and eliminating them as it steps up the magnitudes of the given number

The idea is simply that given any number, it should be possible to find what two other numbers multiply to become it, as a
single integer can only impact up to one order of magnitude larger than itself.

Questions include:  is it faster to load the mulitplicative table from memory or calculate it newly for every calculation, as only 0-9 are important.
